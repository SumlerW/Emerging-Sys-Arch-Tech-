# Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech-
The thermostat project aimed to create a functional prototype that reads room temperature, allows user control of a set temperature, displays system status through LED indicators, and simulates sending data to a server over Wi-Fi. Key functionalities included initializing and managing a state machine to handle system behavior, detecting button presses using GPIOZero for temperature adjustments, reading temperature data via I2C, and using GPIO for LED output to show whether the system is heating, cooling, or idle. The UART interface was also used to simulate sending temperature and status data to the server. The project emphasized coding best practices, including proper formatting, commenting, and modular logic.

The prototype was designed to be compatible with three hardware architectures: Raspberry Pi, Microchip. Raspberry Pi offered the easiest integration with built-in support for GPIO and Wi-Fi using Python. Microchip devices required low-level C programming and external Wi-Fi modules for cloud connectivity. Each platform's ability to support the required code and communication functions was evaluated to ensure future scalability and successful cloud integration.

For this project I feel like the coding came out clean and worked well.  If I had to improve. I would have placed the wires in a cleaner way to make it easier to click the buttons and get a better led screen since the one I had was faulty.  The tools that I used to support my network were a raspberry pi and python.  Skills that I learn for this project can be using for creating software for other machines and hardwares.  Ways that I made the project maintainable, readable was by repeat testing and making sure everything is labeled in the coding if anything need to be changed.  This also made it adaptable for if I need to move something around it would just be a simple name change in the code.
